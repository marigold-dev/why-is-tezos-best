## [1. Decentralization](#decentralization)

Tezos is one of the only **truly decentralized blockchains**. 

People were a long time ago concerned by [Proof-of-Stake and its risk of centralization](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6d1mca/proof_of_stake_leads_to_centralization_with_worse/). In reality, one can just compare the baker distribution of Tezos to the miner distribution of Bitcoin or Ethereum:

Public blockchains are all about decentralisation and transparency, preventing tampering and censorship by distributing their consensus to a maximum number of validator nodes. However, they differ in the overall cost required to operate a node and in the actual distribution of nodes. For instance, running a high-end node such as the one required for the Solana blockchain can cost more than a $1,000 a month. Such blockchains made the choice of a vertical scaling approach: improving the chain's performance requires using always newer hardware. This makes it harder or unprofitable for small operators to join the network's consensus, which in turn will lead to centralization of the nodes in huge data centers.


| Blockchain | Validators | Superminority | 
|------------|------------|---------------|
| **Tezos**  | **409**    | **5**         |
| Algorand   | 323        | 13            |
| Avalanche  | 1240       | 26            |
| BNB Chain  | 26         | 1             |
| Cosmos     | 125        | 7             |
| Flow       | 422        | _?_           |
| Near       | 127        | 10            |
| Polkadot   | 100        | 4             |
| Solana     | 2086       | 30            |


On the other end of the spectrum, Tezos is one of the lightest blockchain, and chooses to run on hardware that costs a fraction of the other blockchains' nodes. With this horizontal scaling approach, applications that require a higher computational power are delegated to specialized rollups or sidechains. This makes it much easier to run a node from smaller data centers, or even from home.


Consistent with this, Tezos requirements for a validator to join the network are among the lowest, as the largest part of the stake can be provided by delegators. Unlike Polkadot, Polygon or Flow, no identification procedure is required to join the network. This makes Tezos one of the most decentralized proof of stake blockchain.

## [2. Self-Amendment and Governance](#governance)

Tezos is the main blockchain with a working Self-Amendment mechanism, going through a proper on-chain Governance process, rather than being controlled by a centralized authority (like the dev team).

While it took Ethereum years to move to Proof-of-Stake, **Tezos is at its 12th version**! Major self-amendments included:
- Two changes of consensus
- The integration of Sapling
- A prototype of Enshrined Rollups

## [3. The Ecosystem](#ecosystem)

Based on its innovative governance and a proven ability to ensure upgradability without discontinuing the chain of blocks or risking assets for its contributors, Tezos has been increasingly able to bring in exciting renowned and new partners, stakeholders and mediatic characters.
 

### The Map of the Tezos ecosystem
 
As an energy-efficient and upgradable protocol, Tezos brings together developers, artists, or institutions that want to build the future of Web3 through entities and applications that can be found on [tezos.com/ecosystem](https://tezos.com/ecosystem). Always evolving, this list displays the majority of all the dozens of projects that are being developed in categories such as: block explorers, baking tools, community, DeFi, Dev Tools, NFTs, Gaming, Digital identity, stablecoins.

### Open source 

An open-source blockchain, Tezos offers a tremendous amount of quality content to start building: an obvious and very user-friendly first step drives to the [Tezos Developer Portal](https://tezos.com/developers/) to explore education, tools, resources, and community. To dive deeper and experiment with the technical and economic concepts behind Tezos, Opentezos.com offers in-depth tutorials and guidelines to  build a dapp step-by-step.

### Arts
 
If Tezos is home to builders, creators, and innovators, art is at the center of all of it, to the point where Tezos called itself **the art blockchain**.

- **Permanent Art Collection (PAC)**: In May 2022, Tezos Foundation launche the first-of-its-kind Permanent Art Collection (PAC), chaired by world-renowned photographer and activist Misan Harriman. Its mission is to enlighten and comprise curated Digital Art Galleries that celebrate artists that create in the Tezos ecosystem.

- **Tezos x Art Basel**:for more than a year, Tezos has partnered with Art Basel to showcase talented local and virtual artists from Miami to Basel to Hong Kong and get the largest audience onboard the blockchain. Their latest joint groundbreaking event features an outdoor fair in Paris for State of the Art (October 19-23).

- Tezos promotes all kinds of cultural events all along the year: Block/Space in Austin (Texas) during SXSW 2022 conference, Tezos Art Week on Twitter, **SonarMàtica** by Tezos in Barcelona to name a few.

- **NFT**: Tezos is definitely a NFT friendly blockchain, home to one of the leading platforms such as objkt.com, Teia and fx(hash). OneOf has also been in the spotlight for welcoming pop idol Doja Cat and iconic producer Quincy Jones, or reggae singer Zigy Marley. To make newcomers and long-time users feel secure and let them focus on their art, the NFT ecosystem keeps growing in a friendly environment gathered together on https://tezos.art/.

- Proof of the strong and deep bond between Tezos and art, its founders Arthur and Kathleen Breitman recently explored, in the recorded interview **Art for Art(ist)'s Sake**, how and why artist communities have flourished on Tezos.
